Warning: Flutter support for your project's Android Gradle Plugin version (Android Gradle Plugin version 8.3.0) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Android Gradle Plugin version to a version of at least Android Gradle Plugin version 8.6.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's AGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\ArenaBrawler-main\ArenaBrawler-main\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of com.android.application. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version. In this case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\ArenaBrawler-main\ArenaBrawler-main\android/build.gradle) by the following line in the dependencies block of the buildscript: "classpath 'com.android.tools.build:gradle:<version>'".

Warning: Flutter support for your project's Kotlin version (1.9.24) will soon be dropped. Please upgrade your Kotlin version to a version of at least 2.1.0 soon.
Alternatively, use the flag "--android-skip-build-dependency-validation" to bypass this check.

Potential fix: Your project's KGP version is typically defined in the plugins block of the `settings.gradle` file (C:\ArenaBrawler-main\ArenaBrawler-main\android/settings.gradle), by a plugin with the id of org.jetbrains.kotlin.android. 
If you don't see a plugins block, your project was likely created with an older template version, in which case it is most likely defined in the top-level build.gradle file (C:\ArenaBrawler-main\ArenaBrawler-main\android/build.gradle) by the ext.kotlin_version property.


> Configure project :audioplayers_android

> Configure project :video_player_android
Warning: The plugin video_player_android requires Android SDK version 36 or higher.
For more information about build configuration, see https://flutter.dev/to/review-gradle-config.
Your project is configured to compile against Android SDK 34, but the following plugin(s) require to be compiled against a higher Android SDK version:
- audioplayers_android compiles against Android SDK 35
- path_provider_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- shared_preferences_android compiles against Android SDK 36
- video_player_android compiles against Android SDK 36
Fix this issue by compiling against the highest Android SDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to C:\ArenaBrawler-main\ArenaBrawler-main\android\app\build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        compileSdk = 36
        ...
    }
Warning: SDK processing. This version only understands SDK XML versions up to 3 but an SDK XML file of version 4 was encountered. This can happen if you use versions of Android Studio and the command-line tools that were released at different times.
WARNING: We recommend using a newer Android Gradle plugin to use compileSdk = 35

This Android Gradle plugin (8.3.0) was tested up to compileSdk = 34.

You are strongly encouraged to update your project to use a newer
Android Gradle plugin that has been tested with compileSdk = 35.

If you are already using the latest version of the Android Gradle plugin,
you may need to wait until a newer version with support for compileSdk = 35 is available.

To suppress this warning, add/update
    android.suppressUnsupportedCompileSdk=35
to this project's gradle.properties.
